# DriftParadise

Simple Drift team website coded in HTML/CSS/JS/.

One-page styled with parrallax effects.

On click of each team member a drawer pulls out of the right side with the member's car + information.

Hover effects applied on images.

Embeded grayscale Google map to fit the design.

To do: minor fixes and RWD.

( The white section on the screenshot is an image with a parrallax effect but for some reason, the website screenshot tool isn't able to capture it. This issue appears on the main image at the beginning as well, it appears to be repeating itself, but that's not the case. )
